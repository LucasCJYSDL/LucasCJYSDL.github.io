👨🏻‍🔬 I received a B.E. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2020. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and Research Assistant in the School of Industrial Engineering (Operation Research) at Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA. Here are some files that may interest you: [resume](http://LucasCJYSDL.github.io/files/Resume.pdf), [research statement on RL] (http://LucasCJYSDL.github.io/files/Research_Statement.pdf), ...

🤖 My current research concentrates on decision-making techniques, such as reinforcement learning and stochastic optimization. My long-term research objective is to develop theoretically sound, robust algorithms for real-life control tasks and data-driven decision-making, under a unified framework of reinforcement learning, optimal control, and stochastic optimization. Importantly, these algorithms will scale effectively, improving as data volume and computing power increase.
