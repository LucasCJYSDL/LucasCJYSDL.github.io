I received a B.E. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2020. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and Research Assistant in the School of Industrial Engineering (Operation Research) at Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA. My research concentrates on reinforcement learning and robotic learning algorithm design, with a current focus on unsupervised reinforcement learning and hierarchical imitation learning. Here are some files that may interest you: [resume](http://LucasCJYSDL.github.io/files/Resume.pdf), [research statement](http://LucasCJYSDL.github.io/files/Research_Statement.pdf), [introduction of my research work](http://LucasCJYSDL.github.io/files/ABOUT_ME.pdf).

My long-term research objective is to extend the capability of reinforcement learning, with a keen focus on analyzing/proposing data-centric and general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms: how can RL agents evolve with data (efficiently)? The grand vision is to broadly deploy reinforcement learning in real-world decision-making and policy-learning tasks (especially for robotics), with an aim to achieve superhuman performance.

Most importantly, I love soccer and sitcoms......
