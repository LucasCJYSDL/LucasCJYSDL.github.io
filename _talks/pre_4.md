This is a presentation of my accepted paper -- Scalable Multi-agent Option Discovery based on Kronecker Graphs, on NeurIPS, which is one of the best conferences on machine learning and artifical intelligence. This is also my first in-person conference. It's a great honor and pleasure for me to meet with great ML/AI researchers from all over the world.
