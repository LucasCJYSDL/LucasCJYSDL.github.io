I have worked with Prof. Vaneet Aggarwal and Prof. Tian Lan as a Ph.D. student/candidate from 2022/07 till now. My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning algorithm design and applications.

Here are the research projects that have been completed:
- Applied Deep Reinforcement Learning on real-life challenges:
    - Developed a multi-transfer freight delivery algorithm that integrates Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and Non-linear Optimization.
    - Developed a Poker AI based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Search.
    - Utilized Decision Transformer to optimize healthcare decision-making for Sepsis treatment, approaching the level of expert performance.
- Algorithm design related to Temporal Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning:
    - Multi-agent Option Discovery algorithms.
    - Unsupervised Option Discovery algorithms.
    - (Meta) Hierarchical Imitation Learning algorithms.
