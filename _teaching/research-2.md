I have worked as a research assistant on driving behavior learning of autonomous vehicles from 2019/09 to 2020/01, under the supervision of Prof. Ching-Yao Chan. 

Here are the research projects completed during this time:
- Developed a lane‑changing simulator of autonomous vehicles based on SUMO for efficient Reinforcement Learning training and evaluation.
- Proposed a novel Meta Learning algorithm for diverse lane‑changing behavior learning of autonomous vehicles, surpassing SOTA baselines.
